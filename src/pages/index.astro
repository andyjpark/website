        Andrew J. Park received his B.S. (Received the Dean’s award for
        graduating first rank in electronic engineering) and M.S. degrees in
        Electronic Engineering from <a
          href="http://ael.khu.ac.kr"
          target="_blank">Kyung Hee University</a
        > in 2019 and 2021, respectively. From 2017 to 2021, he worked in the
        Applied Electromagnetics Lab at Kyung Hee University. During this
        period, he helped develop an AESA radar-integrated M&S software
        supported by the Agency for Defense Development (ADD). His work also
        includes a microwave method to remotely assess the abdominal fat
        thickness and glucose real-time monitoring. He joined <a
          href="grbic.engin.umich.edu"
          target="_blank">Dr. Grbic’s lab</a
        > as a Ph.D. student in June 2022. His current research interests
        include applied electromagnetics, metasurfaces, and radar technologies.
